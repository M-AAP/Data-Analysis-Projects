# Data Analysis Projects

Here are some beginner data analysis projects I have completed in Python and Excel.


## Analysing Retail Sales (Excel)
In this project we take on the role of an analyst for a chain of retail stores. We are tasked with creating a study that explores the chain's performance over the past few years across all categories.


## Exploring Hacker News Posts (Python)

In this project we explore a dataset of posts to a popular technology site, Hacker News. Hacker News is very popular in tech and start-up circles, with the most popular posts getting hundreds and thousands of visitors.

We work with a reduced version of the dataset, a random sample of 20,000 of the posts with at least one comment. We are specifically interested in posts with titles beginning with Ask HN or Show HN, which ask the community a question or show them something of interest. We'll compare these two types of post to ask the following:

- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts received more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?


## Exploring eBay Car Sales Data (Python)

In this project, we'll be working with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The aim of this project is to clean and analyse the used car listings using the NumPy and pandas libraries.


## Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94 (Python)
The I-94 Traffic Dataset
In this project we will analyse a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. The goal of this project is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94, be it weather type, time of day, time of year, etc.


## Identifying Customers Likely to Churn for a Telecommunications Provider (Excel)

We will explore and analyse a dataset from a telecommunications provider, which provides data on 4250 customers in a specific time period. We aim to identify which customers are likely to churn, or stop using the product.


## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets (Python)

We are working as data analysts for a company that builds apps for Android and IOS devices for an English-speaking audience. Our apps are free of charge, so our main source of revenue is in-app ads. Hence the number of users is what determines the revenue for each app - the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. The goal of this project is to clean and analyse data to help our developers understand what kind of app will attract more users.
